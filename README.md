# My Hangman Game

This is my third milestone assignment with Code Institute. Hangman game is a Python terminal game, which runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.
This is a classic hangman game, where the user tries to guess the secret word letter by letter.
The number of incorrect guesses before the game ends is 7.

This site is targeted toward people who have an interest in simple word guessing games and Python.
